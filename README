This is a fork of the Fitxpatrick repo of Euclid Elements, with the Greek text removed. Just download the pdf file if you want to read only the English version.

This repository contains the Latex files required to compile
a Greek/English version of Euclid's Elements. The Greek text
is the standard Heiberg edition. The modern English translation
was authored by Prof. Richard Fitzpatrick (Department of Physics,
University of Texas at Austin).

The files will only compile properly when the following
standard Latex packages are installed:

inputenc/utf8
babel/polutonikogreek/english
psgreek/garamond
charter
parallel
fancyhdr
amssymb
amsmath
epsf
hyperref

The document can be compiled by issuing the command

latex Elements

in the base directory (containing Elements.tex).
